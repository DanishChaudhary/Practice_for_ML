# Practice_for_ML

A simple, daily log of what I learn and practice in AI/ML. I push small, runnable examples and problem solutions to GitHub so my learning stays reproducible and searchable.

> Focus right now: NumPy & Pandas — building fundamentals by solving short problems and small data exercises.

## What this repo is for

* Record what I learn each day (notes, short scripts, notebooks).
* Store solved problems with at least one working script and a small test or example run.
* Keep experiments minimal and reproducible — if it runs on my machine, it should run for me in a clean clone.


## How I add something (3-step habit)

1. Open google colab and create a file with a clear name (zero-padded id helps).
2. Take the data where i can practice on.
3. Run it google colab, commit with a clear message, push.

Example commit message: `feat(numpy): add 001-numpy-basics solution`

## Quick run instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanishChaudhary/Practice_for_ML.git
cd Practice_for_ML
# run a script
python problems/001-numpy-basics/example.py
# or open a notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/example.ipynb
```

If you add heavy libraries, note them in `concepts/<name>/requirements.txt` instead of adding every dependency to root `requirements.txt`.

## Notes / Rules I follow

* Keep examples short and focused. No huge notebooks in `problems/`.
* Code should run (no broken imports). If it needs data, include a tiny sample or instructions to download.
* Use descriptive commit messages and small PRs if collaborating.
