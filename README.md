> A disciplined log of practice problems, experiments and concept notes for Machine Learning and supporting algorithms.  
> The repo is organized so every problem, experiment and concept is reproducible, testable and easy to review.

## Why this repo exists (short)
You're not saving one-off scripts. You’re building a searchable, versioned record of how you learned — problems attempted, solutions shipped, and concept notes that scale into projects. This repo is the single source of truth for that process.

What this really means is:
- Each problem has: statement, input/output examples, clean solution(s), and a small test suite.
- Each concept has: concise notes, references, runnable examples and a minimal experiment.
- Everything is structured so reviewers (you in 6 months included) can jump straight to a working example.
